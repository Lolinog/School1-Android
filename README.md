# School1-Android

For building or testing the Android application, you'll need the current [Android Studio 3.0 Preview](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html) (We need it for Instant App support), the Android Support Libraries, Instant Run SDK, and everything preinstalled.

It is currently the only platform implemented, and will be ported in steps from Bitbucket to Github (not exposing our... ahem... terrific proprietary protocol).

## Testing

There are currently no tests to run. But feel free to create some!
